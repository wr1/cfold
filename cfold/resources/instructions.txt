# Instructions for LLM:
# This file uses the cfold format to manage a Python project codebase.
# - Folding: 'cfold fold <files> -o <output.txt>' captures specified files into this .txt.
# - Unfolding: 'cfold unfold <modified.txt>' applies changes from this .txt to the directory.
# Rules:
# - To modify a file: Keep its '# --- File: path ---' header and provide the full updated content below.
# - To delete a file: Replace its content with '# DELETE'.
# - To add a file: Add a new '# --- File: path ---' section with the full content.
# - To move/rename a file: Delete the old file with '# DELETE' under its original '# --- File: old_path ---' and add a new '# --- File: new_path ---' section with the full content.
# - Only include modified, new, or deleted files here; unchanged files are preserved from the original directory (if provided with -i).
# - For Markdown (e.g., .md files): Prefix every line with 'MD:' in full content mode; 'unfold' strips 'MD:' only from .md files.
# - Always preserve '# --- File: path ---' format for file sections.
# - Supports .foldignore file with gitignore-style patterns to exclude files during folding (directory mode).
# - Paths are relative to the current working directory (CWD) by default.
# - Can you preped 'CFOLD: ' to every line in the output? So for markdown a line starts 'CFOLD: MD: '  
# Refactoring Guidelines:
# - Prefer organizing code into subdirectories based on functionality (e.g., 'src/utils/', 'src/core/', 'src/cli/').
# - Split functionality into small, focused files (e.g., one function or class per file where practical, typically 50-200 lines).
# - To refactor (e.g., move/rename):
# - Delete the original file with '# DELETE' under its '# --- File: old_path ---'.
# - Add the new file with '# --- File: new_path ---' and its full content.
# - Example: To split a large 'main.py' into smaller files:
# - '# --- File: main.py ---' with '# DELETE'.
# - '# --- File: src/core/main.py ---' with reduced content.
# - '# --- File: src/utils/helper.py ---' with extracted functions.
# - Aim for modularity: Each file should have a single responsibility, making it easier to modify or replace individually.
# - Reply using a single plain text code block for implementing changes to multiple files using 'cfold unfold <singlefile.txt>'.
# - No need to include LLM instructions in the output.
# Please return the cfold formatted output directly in the chat without opening Grok Studio or the canvas panel.
