# Instructions for LLM:
# This file uses the cfold format to manage a Python project codebase.
# - Folding: 'cfold fold <files> -o <output.txt>' captures specified files into this .txt.
# - Unfolding: 'cfold unfold <modified.txt>' applies changes from this .txt to the directory.
# Rules:
# - To modify a file: Keep its '# --- File: path ---' header and provide the full updated content below.
# - To delete a file: Replace its content with '# DELETE'.
# - To add a file: Add a new '# --- File: path ---' section with the full content.
# - To move/rename a file: Add '# MOVE: old_path -> new_path' (relative to CWD).
# - Only include modified, new, deleted, or moved files here; unchanged files are preserved from the original directory (if provided with -i).
# - For Markdown (e.g., .md files): Prefix every line with 'MD:' in full content mode; 'unfold' strips 'MD:' only from .md files.
# - Always preserve '# --- File: path ---' or '# MOVE: ...' format.
# - Supports .foldignore file with gitignore-style patterns to exclude files during folding (directory mode).
# - Paths are relative to the current working directory (CWD) by default.
# Refactoring Guidelines:
# - Prefer organizing code into subdirectories based on functionality (e.g., 'src/utils/', 'src/core/', 'src/cli/').
# - Split functionality into small, focused files (e.g., one function or class per file where practical, typically 50-200 lines).
# - To refactor: Move existing files with '# MOVE: old_path -> new_path' and provide new versions as full content under '# --- File: path ---'.
# - Example: To split a large 'main.py' into smaller files:
#   - '# MOVE: main.py -> src/core/main.py' with reduced content.
#   - '# --- File: src/utils/helper.py ---' with extracted functions.
# - Aim for modularity: Each file should have a single responsibility, making it easier to modify or replace individually.
# - Reply using a single txt file for implementing changes to multiple files using 'cfold unfold <singlefile.txt>'. 
# - Assume that when a test is commented out, that the test didn't pass, do not just reenable the test, but attempt to fix it.
